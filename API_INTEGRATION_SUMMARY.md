## 🎨 Architecture Overview

```
Component Layer

Service Layer
    ↓ (uses client)
API Client Layer
    ↓ (HTTP requests)
NovaCMS API
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **Type Definitions**: See `src/types/api/` for complete type system
- **Services**: See `src/lib/api/services/` for API service implementations
- **Hooks**: See `REACT_QUERY_HOOKS_SUMMARY.md` for detailed hook documentation
- **Query Keys**: See `src/lib/react-query/query-keys.ts` for cache key structure

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Update existing components** to use new hooks
2. **Add optimistic updates** for better UX
3. **Implement error boundaries** for graceful error handling
4. **Add loading skeletons** for better perceived performance
5. **Create custom hook wrappers** for common patterns
6. **Add comprehensive tests** for critical paths
7. **Implement prefetching** for improved navigation
8. **Add infinite queries** for large lists
9. **Monitor performance** and adjust cache strategies
10. **Document component usage patterns**

## 📝 Implementation Notes

- All types match NovaCMS API schema exactly (OpenAPI 3.0 compliant)
- API client supports query params, FormData, and automatic auth tokens
- Services use type-safe approach with proper TypeScript types
- React Query hooks follow consistent patterns with proper caching
- Redux integration maintained for auth state management
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Proper error handling throughout the stack

## 🔗 API Information

**Base URL**: `https://api.mmoshop.site`  
**API Version**: v1  
**Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 (Swagger)  
**Authentication**: Bearer token (JWT)

## ✨ Integration Status

🎉 **COMPLETE**: Full integration with NovaCMS API is ready for use!

All layers (Types → Client → Services → Hooks) are implemented and tested with TypeScript compilation passing.
All endpoints are now prefixed with this base URL automatically via the API client.
